## Language Rules
### Global variables
Avoid global variables.
#### Definition
Variables that are declared at the module level or as class attributes.
#### Pros
Occasionally useful.
#### Cons
Has the potential to change module behavior during the import, because assignments to global variables are done when the module is first imported.
#### Decision

Avoid global variables.

While they are technically variables, module-level constants are permitted and encouraged. For example: `MAX_HOLY_HANDGRENADE_COUNT = 3`. Constants must be named using all caps with underscores. See [Naming](#naming) below.

If needed, globals should be declared at the module level and made internal to the module by prepending an _ to the name. External access must be done through public module-level functions. See [Naming](#naming) below.

### Exceptions 

Exceptions are allowed but must be used carefully.

#### Definition 

Exceptions are a means of breaking out of the normal flow of control of a code
block to handle errors or other exceptional conditions.

#### Pros 

The control flow of normal operation code is not cluttered by error-handling
code. It also allows the control flow to skip multiple frames when a certain
condition occurs, e.g., returning from N nested functions in one step instead of
having to carry-through error codes.

#### Cons 

May cause the control flow to be confusing. Easy to miss error cases when making
library calls.

#### Decision 

Exceptions must follow certain conditions:

-   Raise exceptions like this: `raise MyError('Error message')` or `raise
    MyError()`. Do not use the two-argument form (`raise MyError, 'Error
    message'`).

-   Make use of built-in exception classes when it makes sense. For example,
    raise a `ValueError` to indicate a programming mistake like a violated
    precondition (such as if you were passed a negative number but required a
    positive one). Do not use `assert` statements for validating argument values
    of a public API. `assert` is used to ensure internal correctness, not to
    enforce correct usage nor to indicate that some unexpected event occurred.
    If an exception is desired in the latter cases, use a raise statement. For
    example:

    
    ```python
    Yes:
      def connect_to_next_port(self, minimum):
        """Connects to the next available port.

        Args:
          minimum: A port value greater or equal to 1024.

        Returns:
          The new minimum port.

        Raises:
          ConnectionError: If no available port is found.
        """
        if minimum < 1024:
          # Note that this raising of ValueError is not mentioned in the doc
          # string's "Raises:" section because it is not appropriate to
          # guarantee this specific behavioral reaction to API misuse.
          raise ValueError(f'Min. port must be at least 1024, not {minimum}.')
        port = self._find_next_open_port(minimum)
        if not port:
          raise ConnectionError(
              f'Could not connect to service on port {minimum} or higher.')
        assert port >= minimum, (
            f'Unexpected port {port} when minimum was {minimum}.')
        return port
    ```

    ```python
    No:
      def connect_to_next_port(self, minimum):
        """Connects to the next available port.

        Args:
          minimum: A port value greater or equal to 1024.

        Returns:
          The new minimum port.
        """
        assert minimum >= 1024, 'Minimum port must be at least 1024.'
        port = self._find_next_open_port(minimum)
        assert port is not None
        return port
    ```

-   Libraries or packages may define their own exceptions. When doing so they
    must inherit from an existing exception class. Exception names should end in
    `Error` and should not introduce stutter (`foo.FooError`).

-   Never use catch-all `except:` statements, or catch `Exception` or
    `StandardError`, unless you are

    -   re-raising the exception, or
    -   creating an isolation point in the program where exceptions are not
        propagated but are recorded and suppressed instead, such as protecting a
        thread from crashing by guarding its outermost block.

    Python is very tolerant in this regard and `except:` will really catch
    everything including misspelled names, sys.exit() calls, Ctrl+C interrupts,
    unittest failures and all kinds of other exceptions that you simply don't
    want to catch.

-   Minimize the amount of code in a `try`/`except` block. The larger the body
    of the `try`, the more likely that an exception will be raised by a line of
    code that you didn't expect to raise an exception. In those cases, the
    `try`/`except` block hides a real error.

-   Use the `finally` clause to execute code whether or not an exception is
    raised in the `try` block. This is often useful for cleanup, i.e., closing a
    file.

-   When capturing an exception, use `as` rather than a comma. For example:

    
    ```python
    try:
      raise Error()
    except Error as error:
      pass
    ```
### Comprehensions & Generator Expressions 

Okay to use for simple cases.

#### Definition 

List, Dict, and Set comprehensions as well as generator expressions provide a
concise and efficient way to create container types and iterators without
resorting to the use of traditional loops, `map()`, `filter()`, or `lambda`.

#### Pros 

Simple comprehensions can be clearer and simpler than other dict, list, or set
creation techniques. Generator expressions can be very efficient, since they
avoid the creation of a list entirely.


#### Cons 

Complicated comprehensions or generator expressions can be hard to read.

#### Decision 

Okay to use for simple cases. Each portion must fit on one line: mapping
expression, `for` clause, filter expression. Multiple `for` clauses or filter
expressions are not permitted. Use loops instead when things get more
complicated.

```python
Yes:
  result = [mapping_expr for value in iterable if filter_expr]

  result = [{'key': value} for value in iterable
            if a_long_filter_expression(value)]

  result = [complicated_transform(x)
            for x in iterable if predicate(x)]

  descriptive_name = [
      transform({'key': key, 'value': value}, color='black')
      for key, value in generate_iterable(some_input)
      if complicated_condition_is_met(key, value)
  ]

  result = []
  for x in range(10):
      for y in range(5):
          if x * y > 10:
              result.append((x, y))

  return {x: complicated_transform(x)
          for x in long_generator_function(parameter)
          if x is not None}

  squares_generator = (x**2 for x in range(10))

  unique_names = {user.name for user in users if user is not None}

  eat(jelly_bean for jelly_bean in jelly_beans
      if jelly_bean.color == 'black')
```

```python
No:
  result = [complicated_transform(
                x, some_argument=x+1)
            for x in iterable if predicate(x)]

  result = [(x, y) for x in range(10) for y in range(5) if x * y > 10]

  return ((x, y, z)
          for x in range(5)
          for y in range(5)
          if x != y
          for z in range(5)
          if y != z)
```
### Default Iterators and Operators 

Use default iterators and operators for types that support them, like lists,
dictionaries, and files.

#### Definition 

Container types, like dictionaries and lists, define default iterators and
membership test operators ("in" and "not in").

#### Pros 

The default iterators and operators are simple and efficient. They express the
operation directly, without extra method calls. A function that uses default
operators is generic. It can be used with any type that supports the operation.

#### Cons 

You can't tell the type of objects by reading the method names (e.g. `has_key()`
means a dictionary). This is also an advantage.

#### Decision 

Use default iterators and operators for types that support them, like lists,
dictionaries, and files. The built-in types define iterator methods, too. Prefer
these methods to methods that return lists, except that you should not mutate a
container while iterating over it. Never use Python 2 specific iteration methods
such as `dict.iter*()` unless necessary.

```python
Yes:  for key in adict: ...
      if key not in adict: ...
      if obj in alist: ...
      for line in afile: ...
      for k, v in adict.items(): ...
      for k, v in six.iteritems(adict): ...
```

```python
No:   for key in adict.keys(): ...
      if not adict.has_key(key): ...
      for line in afile.readlines(): ...
      for k, v in dict.iteritems(): ...
```

### Default Argument Values 

Okay in most cases.

#### Definition 

You can specify values for variables at the end of a function's parameter list,
e.g., `def foo(a, b=0):`. If `foo` is called with only one argument, `b` is set
to 0. If it is called with two arguments, `b` has the value of the second
argument.

#### Pros 

Often you have a function that uses lots of default values, but on rare
occasions you want to override the defaults. Default argument values provide an
easy way to do this, without having to define lots of functions for the rare
exceptions. As Python does not support overloaded methods/functions, default
arguments are an easy way of "faking" the overloading behavior.

#### Cons 

Default arguments are evaluated once at module load time. This may cause
problems if the argument is a mutable object such as a list or a dictionary. If
the function modifies the object (e.g., by appending an item to a list), the
default value is modified.

#### Decision 

Okay to use with the following caveat:

Do not use mutable objects as default values in the function or method
definition.

```python
Yes: def foo(a, b=None):
         if b is None:
             b = []
Yes: def foo(a, b: Optional[Sequence] = None):
         if b is None:
             b = []
Yes: def foo(a, b: Sequence = ()):  # Empty tuple OK since tuples are immutable
         ...
```

```python
No:  def foo(a, b=[]):
         ...
No:  def foo(a, b=time.time()):  # The time the module was loaded???
         ...
No:  def foo(a, b=FLAGS.my_thing):  # sys.argv has not yet been parsed...
         ...
No:  def foo(a, b: Mapping = {}):  # Could still get passed to unchecked code
         ...
```
### Properties 

Use properties for accessing or setting data where you would normally have used
simple, lightweight accessor or setter methods.

#### Definition 

A way to wrap method calls for getting and setting an attribute as a standard
attribute access when the computation is lightweight.


#### Pros 

Readability is increased by eliminating explicit get and set method calls for
simple attribute access. Allows calculations to be lazy. Considered the Pythonic
way to maintain the interface of a class. In terms of performance, allowing
properties bypasses needing trivial accessor methods when a direct variable
access is reasonable. This also allows accessor methods to be added in the
future without breaking the interface.

#### Cons 

Must inherit from `object` in Python 2. Can hide side-effects much like operator
overloading. Can be confusing for subclasses.

#### Decision 

Use properties in new code to access or set data where you would normally have
used simple, lightweight accessor or setter methods. Properties should be
created with the `@property` decorator.

Inheritance with properties can be non-obvious if the property itself is not
overridden. Thus one must make sure that accessor methods are called indirectly
to ensure methods overridden in subclasses are called by the property.

```python
Yes: import math

     class Square:
         """A square with two properties: a writable area and a read-only perimeter.

         To use:
         >>> sq = Square(3)
         >>> sq.area
         9
         >>> sq.perimeter
         12
         >>> sq.area = 16
         >>> sq.side
         4
         >>> sq.perimeter
         16
         """

         def __init__(self, side):
             self.side = side

         @property
         def area(self):
             """Area of the square."""
             return self._get_area()

         @area.setter
         def area(self, area):
             return self._set_area(area)

         def _get_area(self):
             """Indirect accessor to calculate the 'area' property."""
             return self.side ** 2

         def _set_area(self, area):
             """Indirect setter to set the 'area' property."""
             self.side = math.sqrt(area)

         @property
         def perimeter(self):
             return self.side * 4
```
### True/False Evaluations 

Use the "implicit" false if at all possible.

#### Definition 

Python evaluates certain values as `False` when in a boolean context. A quick
"rule of thumb" is that all "empty" values are considered false, so `0, None,
[], {}, ''` all evaluate as false in a boolean context.

#### Pros 

Conditions using Python booleans are easier to read and less error-prone. In
most cases, they're also faster.

#### Cons 

May look strange to C/C++ developers.

#### Decision 

Use the "implicit" false if possible, e.g., `if foo:` rather than `if foo !=
[]:`. There are a few caveats that you should keep in mind though:

-   Always use `if foo is None:` (or `is not None`) to check for a `None` value.
    E.g., when testing whether a variable or argument that defaults to `None`
    was set to some other value. The other value might be a value that's false
    in a boolean context!

-   Never compare a boolean variable to `False` using `==`. Use `if not x:`
    instead. If you need to distinguish `False` from `None` then chain the
    expressions, such as `if not x and x is not None:`.

-   For sequences (strings, lists, tuples), use the fact that empty sequences
    are false, so `if seq:` and `if not seq:` are preferable to `if len(seq):`
    and `if not len(seq):` respectively.

-   When handling integers, implicit false may involve more risk than benefit
    (i.e., accidentally handling `None` as 0). You may compare a value which is
    known to be an integer (and is not the result of `len()`) against the
    integer 0.

    ```python
    Yes: if not users:
             print('no users')

         if foo == 0:
             self.handle_zero()

         if i % 10 == 0:
             self.handle_multiple_of_ten()

         def f(x=None):
             if x is None:
                 x = []
    ```

    ```python
    No:  if len(users) == 0:
             print('no users')

         if foo is not None and not foo:
             self.handle_zero()

         if not i % 10:
             self.handle_multiple_of_ten()

         def f(x=None):
             x = x or []
    ```

-   Note that `'0'` (i.e., `0` as string) evaluates to true.


### Deprecated Language Features 

Use string methods instead of the `string` module where possible. Use function
call syntax instead of `apply`. Use list comprehensions and `for` loops instead
of `filter` and `map` when the function argument would have been an inlined
lambda anyway. Use `for` loops instead of `reduce`.

#### Definition 

Current versions of Python provide alternative constructs that people find
generally preferable.


#### Decision 

We do not use any Python version which does not support these features, so there
is no reason not to use the new styles.

```python
Yes: words = foo.split(':')

     [x[1] for x in my_list if x[2] == 5]

     map(math.sqrt, data)    # Ok. No inlined lambda expression.

     fn(*args, **kwargs)
```

```python
No:  words = string.split(foo, ':')

     map(lambda x: x[1], filter(lambda x: x[2] == 5, my_list))

     apply(fn, args, kwargs)
```
### Type Annotated Code 

You can annotate Python 3 code with type hints according to
[PEP-484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/), and type-check the code at
build time with a type checking tool like [pytype](https://github.com/google/pytype) or [pyright](https://github.com/microsoft/pyright).


Type annotations can be in the source or in a
[stub pyi file](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/#stub-files). Whenever
possible, annotations should be in the source. Use pyi files for third-party or
extension modules.

#### Definition 

Type annotations (or "type hints") are for function or method arguments and
return values:

```python
def func(a: int) -> List[int]:
```

You can also declare the type of a variable using similar
[PEP-526](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0526/) syntax:

```python
a: SomeType = some_func()
```

Or by using a type comment in code that must support legacy Python versions.

```python
a = some_func()  # type: SomeType
```

#### Pros 

Type annotations improve the readability and maintainability of your code. The
type checker will convert many runtime errors to build-time errors, and reduce
your ability to use Power Features.

#### Cons 

You will have to keep the type declarations up to date.
You might see type errors that you think are
valid code. Use of a
[type checker](https://github.com/google/pytype)
may reduce your ability to use [Power Features](#power-features).

#### Decision 

You are encouraged to enable Python type analysis when updating code.
When adding or modifying public APIs, include type annotations and enable
checking via pytype or pyright in the build system. As static analysis is relatively new to
Python, it is acknowledged that undesired side-effects (such as
wrongly
inferred types) may prevent adoption by some projects. In those situations,
authors are encouraged to add a comment with a TODO or link to a bug describing
the issue(s) currently preventing type annotation adoption in the BUILD file or
in the code itself as appropriate.


## Python Style Rules

### Black
[Black ](https://github.com/psf/black) is a PEP 8 compliant opinionated formatter. Black reformats entire 
files in place. It is not configurable. It doesn't take previous 
formatting into account. Your main option of configuring Black is that 
it doesn't reformat blocks that start with `# fmt: off` and 
end with `# fmt: on`. `# fmt: on/off` have to be on the same level of 
indentation. To learn more about Black's opinions, to go 
[the_black_code_style](https://github.com/psf/black/blob/master/docs/the_black_code_style.md).

It is extremely recommended to read teh [Black Readme](https://github.com/psf/black)



### Comments and Docstrings 

Be sure to use the right style for module, function, method docstrings and
inline comments.

#### Docstrings 

Python uses _docstrings_ to document code. A docstring is a string that is the
first statement in a package, module, class or function. These strings can be
extracted automatically through the `__doc__` member of the object and are used
by `pydoc`.
(Try running `pydoc` on your module to see how it looks.) Always use the three
double-quote `"""` format for docstrings (per
[PEP 257](https://www.google.com/url?sa=D&q=http://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0257/)).
A docstring should be organized as a summary line (one physical line not
exceeding 80 characters) terminated by a period, question mark, or exclamation
point. When writing more (encouraged), this must be followed by a blank line,
followed by the rest of the docstring starting at the same cursor position as
the first quote of the first line. There are more formatting guidelines for
docstrings below.

#### Modules 

Files should start with a docstring for a better understanding 
and maintenance of the code, the header of 
different modules should follow some standard format and information.

#### Functions and Methods 

In this section, "function" means a method, function, or generator.

A function must have a docstring, unless it meets all of the following criteria:

-   not externally visible
-   very short
-   obvious

A docstring should give enough information to write a call to the function
without reading the function's code. The docstring should be descriptive-style
(`"""Fetches rows from a Bigtable."""`) rather than imperative-style (`"""Fetch
rows from a Bigtable."""`), except for `@property` data descriptors, which
should use the <a href="#384-classes">same style as attributes</a>. A docstring
should describe the function's calling syntax and its semantics, not its
implementation. For tricky code, comments alongside the code are more
appropriate than using docstrings.

A method that overrides a method from a base class may have a simple docstring
sending the reader to its overridden method's docstring, such as `"""See base
class."""`. The rationale is that there is no need to repeat in many places
documentation that is already present in the base method's docstring. However,
if the overriding method's behavior is substantially different from the
overridden method, or details need to be provided (e.g., documenting additional
side effects), a docstring with at least those differences is required on the
overriding method.

Certain aspects of a function should be documented in special sections, listed
below. Each section begins with a heading line, which ends with a colon. All
sections other than the heading should maintain a hanging indent of two or four
spaces (be consistent within a file). These sections can be omitted in cases
where the function's name and signature are informative enough that it can be
aptly described using a one-line docstring.

<a id="doc-function-args"></a>
[*Args:*](#doc-function-args)
:   List each parameter by name. A description should follow the name, and be
    separated by a colon followed by either a space or newline. If the
    description is too long to fit on a single 80-character line, use a hanging
    indent of 2 or 4 spaces more than the parameter name (be consistent with the
    rest of the docstrings in the file). The description should include required
    type(s) if the code does not contain a corresponding type annotation. If a
    function accepts `*foo` (variable length argument lists) and/or `**bar`
    (arbitrary keyword arguments), they should be listed as `*foo` and `**bar`.

<a id="doc-function-returns"></a>
[*Returns:* (or *Yields:* for generators)](#doc-function-returns)
:   Describe the type and semantics of the return value. If the function only
    returns None, this section is not required. It may also be omitted if the
    docstring starts with Returns or Yields (e.g. `"""Returns row from Bigtable
    as a tuple of strings."""`) and the opening sentence is sufficient to
    describe return value.

<a id="doc-function-raises"></a>
[*Raises:*](#doc-function-raises)
:   List all exceptions that are relevant to the interface followed by a
    description. Use a similar exception name + colon + space or newline and
    hanging indent style as described in *Args:*. You should not document
    exceptions that get raised if the API specified in the docstring is violated
    (because this would paradoxically make behavior under violation of the API
    part of the API).

```python
def fetch_smalltable_rows(table_handle: smalltable.Table,
                          keys: Sequence[Union[bytes, str]],
                          require_all_keys: bool = False,
                         ) -> Mapping[bytes, Tuple[str]]:
    """Fetches rows from a Smalltable.

    Retrieves rows pertaining to the given keys from the Table instance
    represented by table_handle.  String keys will be UTF-8 encoded.

    Args:
        table_handle: An open smalltable.Table instance.
        keys: A sequence of strings representing the key of each table
          row to fetch.  String keys will be UTF-8 encoded.
        require_all_keys: Optional; If require_all_keys is True only
          rows with values set for all keys will be returned.

    Returns:
        A dict mapping keys to the corresponding table row data
        fetched. Each row is represented as a tuple of strings. For
        example:

        {b'Serak': ('Rigel VII', 'Preparer'),
         b'Zim': ('Irk', 'Invader'),
         b'Lrrr': ('Omicron Persei 8', 'Emperor')}

        Returned keys are always bytes.  If a key from the keys argument is
        missing from the dictionary, then that row was not found in the
        table (and require_all_keys must have been False).

    Raises:
        IOError: An error occurred accessing the smalltable.
    """
```

Similarly, this variation on `Args:` with a line break is also allowed:

```python
def fetch_smalltable_rows(table_handle: smalltable.Table,
                          keys: Sequence[Union[bytes, str]],
                          require_all_keys: bool = False,
                         ) -> Mapping[bytes, Tuple[str]]:
    """Fetches rows from a Smalltable.

      keys:
        A sequence of strings representing the key of each table row to
        fetch.  String keys will be UTF-8 encoded.

        Optional; If require_all_keys is True only rows with values set
        for all keys will be returned.

    Returns:

      Returned keys are always bytes.  If a key from the keys argument is
      missing from the dictionary, then that row was not found in the
      table (and require_all_keys must have been False).

    Raises:
      IOError: An error occurred accessing the smalltable.
    """
```

#### Classes 

Classes should have a docstring below the class definition describing the class.
If your class has public attributes, they should be documented here in an
`Attributes` section and follow the same formatting as a
[function's `Args`](#doc-function-args) section.

```python
class SampleClass:
    """Summary of class here.

    Longer class information....
    Longer class information....

    Attributes:
        likes_spam: A boolean indicating if we like SPAM or not.
        eggs: An integer count of the eggs we have laid.
    """

    def __init__(self, likes_spam=False):
        """Inits SampleClass with blah."""
        self.likes_spam = likes_spam
        self.eggs = 0

    def public_method(self):
        """Performs operation blah."""
```


#### Block and Inline Comments 

The final place to have comments is in tricky parts of the code. If you're going
to have to explain it at the next [code review](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Code_review),
you should comment it now. Complicated operations get a few lines of comments
before the operations commence. Non-obvious ones get comments at the end of the
line.

```python
# We use a weighted dictionary search to find out where i is in
# the array.  We extrapolate position based on the largest num
# in the array and the array size and then do binary search to
# get the exact number.

if i & (i-1) == 0:  # True if i is 0 or a power of 2.
```

To improve legibility, these comments should start at least 2 spaces away from
the code with the comment character `#`, followed by at least one space before
the text of the comment itself.

On the other hand, never describe the code. Assume the person reading the code
knows Python (though not what you're trying to do) better than you do.

```python
# BAD COMMENT: Now go through the b array and make sure whenever i occurs
# the next element is i+1
```



#### Punctuation, Spelling, and Grammar 

Pay attention to punctuation, spelling, and grammar; it is easier to read
well-written comments than badly written ones.

Comments should be as readable as narrative text, with proper capitalization and
punctuation. In many cases, complete sentences are more readable than sentence
fragments. Shorter comments, such as comments at the end of a line of code, can
sometimes be less formal, but you should be consistent with your style.

Although it can be frustrating to have a code reviewer point out that you are
using a comma when you should be using a semicolon, it is very important that
source code maintain a high level of clarity and readability. Proper
punctuation, spelling, and grammar help with that goal.

### TODO Comments 

Use `TODO` comments for code that is temporary, a short-term solution, or
good-enough but not perfect.

A `TODO` comment begins with the string `TODO` in all caps and a parenthesized
name, e-mail address, or other identifier
of the person or issue with the best context about the problem. This is followed
by an explanation of what there is to do.

The purpose is to have a consistent `TODO` format that can be searched to find
out how to get more details. A `TODO` is not a commitment that the person
referenced will fix the problem. Thus when you create a
`TODO`, it is almost always your name
that is given.

```python
# TODO(Michael): Use a "*" here for string repetition.
# TODO(YourNameHere) Change this to use relations.
```

If your `TODO` is of the form "At a future date do something" make sure that you
either include a very specific date ("Fix by November 2009") or a very specific
event ("Remove this code when all clients can handle XML responses.").

### Naming 

`module_name`, `package_name`, `ClassName`, `method_name`, `ExceptionName`,
`function_name`, `GLOBAL_CONSTANT_NAME`, `global_var_name`, `instance_var_name`,
`function_parameter_name`, `local_var_name`.


Function names, variable names, and filenames should be descriptive; eschew
abbreviation. In particular, do not use abbreviations that are ambiguous or
unfamiliar to readers outside your project, and do not abbreviate by deleting
letters within a word.

Always use a `.py` filename extension. Never use dashes.

#### Names to Avoid 

-   single character names, except for specifically allowed cases:

    -   counters or iterators (e.g. `i`, `j`, `k`, `v`, et al)
    -   `e` as an exception identifier in `try/except` statements.
    -   `f` as a file handle in `with` statements

    Please be mindful not to abuse single-character naming. Generally speaking,
    descriptiveness should be proportional to the name's scope of visibility.
    For example, `i` might be a fine name for 5-line code block but within
    multiple nested scopes, it is likely too vague.

-   dashes (`-`) in any package/module name

-   `__double_leading_and_trailing_underscore__` names (reserved by Python)

-   offensive terms


#### Naming Conventions 

-   "Internal" means internal to a module, or protected or private within a
    class.

-   Prepending a single underscore (`_`) has some support for protecting module
    variables and functions (linters will flag protected member access). While
    prepending a double underscore (`__` aka "dunder") to an instance variable
    or method effectively makes the variable or method private to its class
    (using name mangling) we discourage its use as it impacts readability and
    testability and isn't *really* private.

-   Place related classes and top-level functions together in a
    module.
    Unlike Java, there is no need to limit yourself to one class per module.

-   Use CapWords for class names, but lower\_with\_under.py for module names.
    Although there are some old modules named CapWords.py, this is now
    discouraged because it's confusing when the module happens to be named after
    a class. ("wait -- did I write `import StringIO` or `from StringIO import
    StringIO`?")

-   Underscores may appear in *unittest* method names starting with `test` to
    separate logical components of the name, even if those components use
    CapWords. One possible pattern is `test<MethodUnderTest>_<state>`; for
    example `testPop_EmptyStack` is okay. There is no One Correct Way to name
    test methods.

#### File Naming 

Python filenames must have a `.py` extension and must not contain dashes (`-`).
This allows them to be imported and unittested. If you want an executable to be
accessible without the extension, use a symbolic link or a simple bash wrapper
containing `exec "$0.py" "$@"`.

### Function length 

Prefer small and focused functions.

It is recognized that long functions are sometimes appropriate, so no hard limit is
placed on function length. If a function exceeds about 40 lines, think about
whether it can be broken up without harming the structure of the program.

Even if your long function works perfectly now, someone modifying it in a few
months may add new behavior. This could result in bugs that are hard to find.
Keeping your functions short and simple makes it easier for other people to read
and modify your code.

You could find long and complicated functions when working with some
code. Do not be intimidated by modifying existing code: if working with such a
function proves to be difficult, you find that errors are hard to debug, or you
want to use a piece of it in several different contexts, consider breaking up
the function into smaller and more manageable pieces.

### Type Annotations 

#### General Rules 

*   Familiarize yourself with
    [PEP-484](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/).
*   In methods, only annotate `self`, or `cls` if it is necessary for proper
    type information. e.g., `@classmethod def create(cls: Type[T]) -> T: return
    cls()`
*   If any other variable or a returned type should not be expressed, use `Any`.
*   You are not required to annotate all the functions in a module.
    -   At least annotate your public APIs.
    -   Use judgment to get to a good balance between safety and clarity on the
        one hand, and flexibility on the other.
    -   Annotate code that is prone to type-related errors (previous bugs or
        complexity).
    -   Annotate code that is hard to understand.
    -   Annotate code as it becomes stable from a types perspective. In many
        cases, you can annotate all the functions in mature code without losing
        too much flexibility.


#### Line Breaking 

After annotating, many function signatures will become "one parameter per line".

```python
def my_method(self,
              first_var: int,
              second_var: Foo,
              third_var: Optional[Bar]) -> int:
  ...
```

Always prefer breaking between variables, and not, for example, between variable
names and type annotations. However, if everything fits on the same line, go for
it.

```python
def my_method(self, first_var: int) -> int:
  ...
```

If the combination of the function name, the last parameter, and the return type
is too long, indent by 4 in a new line.

```python
def my_method(
    self, first_var: int) -> Tuple[MyLongType1, MyLongType1]:
  ...
```

When the return type does not fit on the same line as the last parameter, the
preferred way is to indent the parameters by 4 on a new line and align the
closing parenthesis with the `def`.

```python
Yes:
def my_method(
    self, other_arg: Optional[MyLongType]
) -> Dict[OtherLongType, MyLongType]:
  ...
```

`pylint`
allows you to move the closing parenthesis to a new line and align with the
opening one, but this is less readable.

```python
No:
def my_method(self,
              other_arg: Optional[MyLongType]
             ) -> Dict[OtherLongType, MyLongType]:
  ...
```

As in the examples above, prefer not to break types. However, sometimes they are
too long to be on a single line (try to keep sub-types unbroken).

```python
def my_method(
    self,
    first_var: Tuple[List[MyLongType1],
                     List[MyLongType2]],
    second_var: List[Dict[
        MyLongType3, MyLongType4]]) -> None:
  ...
```

If a single name and type is too long, consider using an
[alias](#typing-aliases) for the type. The last resort is to break after the
colon and indent by 4.

```python
Yes:
def my_function(
    long_variable_name:
        long_module_name.LongTypeName,
) -> None:
  ...
```

```python
No:
def my_function(
    long_variable_name: long_module_name.
        LongTypeName,
) -> None:
  ...
```


#### Forward Declarations 

If you need to use a class name from the same module that is not yet defined --
for example, if you need the class inside the class declaration, or if you use a
class that is defined below -- use a string for the class name.

```python
class MyClass:

  def __init__(self,
               stack: List["MyClass"]) -> None:
```


#### Default Values 

As per
[PEP-008](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0008/#other-recommendations), use
spaces around the `=` _only_ for arguments that have both a type annotation and
a default value.

```python
Yes:
def func(a: int = 0) -> int:
  ...
```

```python
No:
def func(a:int=0) -> int:
  ...
```


#### NoneType 

In the Python type system, `NoneType` is a "first class" type, and for typing
purposes, `None` is an alias for `NoneType`. If an argument can be `None`, it
has to be declared! You can use `Union`, but if there is only one other type,
use `Optional`.

Use explicit `Optional` instead of implicit `Optional`. Earlier versions of PEP
484 allowed `a: Text = None` to be interpretted as `a: Optional[Text] = None`,
but that is no longer the preferred behavior.

```python
Yes:
def func(a: Optional[Text], b: Optional[Text] = None) -> Text:
  ...
def multiple_nullable_union(a: Union[None, Text, int]) -> Text
  ...
```

```python
No:
def nullable_union(a: Union[None, Text]) -> Text:
  ...
def implicit_optional(a: Text = None) -> Text:
  ...
```


#### Type Aliases 

You can declare aliases of complex types. The name of an alias should be
CapWorded. If the alias is used only in this module, it should be \_Private.

For example, if the name of the module together with the name of the type is too
long:

```python
_ShortName = module_with_long_name.TypeWithLongName
ComplexMap = Mapping[Text, List[Tuple[int, int]]]
```

Other examples are complex nested types and multiple return variables from a
function (as a tuple).


#### Ignoring Types 

You can disable type checking on a line with the special comment `# type:
ignore`.

`pytype` has a disable option for specific errors (similar to lint):

```python
# pytype: disable=attribute-error
```


#### Typing Variables 

If an internal variable has a type that is hard or impossible to infer, you can
specify its type in a couple ways.


[*Type Comments:*](#type-comments)
:   Use a `# type:` comment on the end of the line

```python
a = SomeUndecoratedFunction()  # type: Foo
```


[*Annotated Assignments*](#annotated-assignments)
:   Use a colon and type between the variable name and value, as with function
    arguments.

```python
a: Foo = SomeUndecoratedFunction()
```


#### Tuples vs Lists 

Typed lists can only contain objects of a single type. Typed tuples can either
have a single repeated type or a set number of elements with different types.
The latter is commonly used as the return type from a function.

```python
a = [1, 2, 3]  # type: List[int]
b = (1, 2, 3)  # type: Tuple[int, ...]
c = (1, "2", 3.5)  # type: Tuple[int, Text, float]
```


#### TypeVars 

The Python type system has
[generics](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/#generics). The factory
function `TypeVar` is a common way to use them.

Example:

```python
from typing import List, TypeVar
T = TypeVar("T")
...
def next(l: List[T]) -> T:
  return l.pop()
```

A TypeVar can be constrained:

```python
AddableType = TypeVar("AddableType", int, float, Text)
def add(a: AddableType, b: AddableType) -> AddableType:
  return a + b
```

A common predefined type variable in the `typing` module is `AnyStr`. Use it for
multiple annotations that can be `bytes` or `unicode` and must all be the same
type.

```python
from typing import AnyStr
def check_length(x: AnyStr) -> AnyStr:
  if len(x) <= 42:
    return x
  raise ValueError()
```

#### String types 

The proper type for annotating strings depends on what versions of Python the
code is intended for.

For Python 3 only code, prefer to use `str`. `Text` is also acceptable. Be
consistent in using one or the other.

For Python 2 compatible code, use `Text`. In some rare cases, `str` may make
sense; typically to aid compatibility when the return types aren't the same
between the two Python versions. Avoid using `unicode`: it doesn't exist in
Python 3.

The reason this discrepancy exists is because `str` means different things
depending on the Python version.

```python
No:
def py2_code(x: str) -> unicode:
  ...
```

For code that deals with binary data, use `bytes`.

```python
def deals_with_binary_data(x: bytes) -> bytes:
  ...
```

For Python 2 compatible code that processes text data (`str` or `unicode` in
Python 2, `str` in Python 3), use `Text`. For Python 3 only code that process
text data, prefer `str`.

```python
from typing import Text
...
def py2_compatible(x: Text) -> Text:
  ...
def py3_only(x: str) -> str:
  ...
```

If the type can be either bytes or text, use `Union`, with the appropriate text
type.

```python
from typing import Text, Union
...
def py2_compatible(x: Union[bytes, Text]) -> Union[bytes, Text]:
  ...
def py3_only(x: Union[bytes, str]) -> Union[bytes, str]:
  ...
```

If all the string types of a function are always the same, for example if the
return type is the same as the argument type in the code above, use
[AnyStr](#typing-type-var).

Writing it like this will simplify the process of porting the code to Python 3.


#### Imports For Typing 

For classes from the `typing` module, always import the class itself. You are
explicitly allowed to import multiple specific classes on one line from the
`typing` module. Ex:

```python
from typing import Any, Dict, Optional
```

Given that this way of importing from `typing` adds items to the local
namespace, any names in `typing` should be treated similarly to keywords, and
not be defined in your Python code, typed or not. If there is a collision
between a type and an existing name in a module, import it using `import x as
y`.

```python
from typing import Any as AnyType
```


#### Conditional Imports 

Use conditional imports only in exceptional cases where the additional imports
needed for type checking must be avoided at runtime. This pattern is
discouraged; alternatives such as refactoring the code to allow top level
imports should be preferred.

Imports that are needed only for type annotations can be placed within an `if
TYPE_CHECKING:` block.

-   Conditionally imported types need to be referenced as strings, to be forward
    compatible with Python 3.6 where the annotation expressions are actually
    evaluated.
-   Only entities that are used solely for typing should be defined here; this
    includes aliases. Otherwise it will be a runtime error, as the module will
    not be imported at runtime.
-   The block should be right after all the normal imports.
-   There should be no empty lines in the typing imports list.
-   Sort this list as if it were a regular imports list.
```python
import typing
if typing.TYPE_CHECKING:
  import sketch
def f(x: "sketch.Sketch"): ...
```

#### Circular Dependencies 

Circular dependencies that are caused by typing are code smells. Such code is a
good candidate for refactoring. Although technically it is possible to keep
circular dependencies, the [build system](#typing-build-deps) will not let you
do so because each module has to depend on the other.

Replace modules that create circular dependency imports with `Any`. Set an
[alias](#typing-aliases) with a meaningful name, and use the real type name from
this module (any attribute of Any is Any). Alias definitions should be separated
from the last import by one line.

```python
from typing import Any

some_mod = Any  # some_mod.py imports this module.
...

def my_method(self, var: "some_mod.SomeType") -> None:
  ...
```

#### Generics 

When annotating, prefer to specify type parameters for generic types; otherwise,
[the generics' parameters will be assumed to be `Any`](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0484/#the-any-type).

```python
def get_names(employee_ids: List[int]) -> Dict[int, Any]:
  ...
```

```python
# These are both interpreted as get_names(employee_ids: List[Any]) -> Dict[Any, Any]
def get_names(employee_ids: list) -> Dict:
  ...

def get_names(employee_ids: List) -> Dict:
  ...
```

If the best type parameter for a generic is `Any`, make it explicit, but
remember that in many cases [`TypeVar`](#typing-type-var) might be more
appropriate:

```python
def get_names(employee_ids: List[Any]) -> Dict[Any, Text]:
  """Returns a mapping from employee ID to employee name for given IDs."""
```

```python
T = TypeVar('T')
def get_names(employee_ids: List[T]) -> Dict[T, Text]:
  """Returns a mapping from employee ID to employee name for given IDs."""
```



## Parting Words 

*BE CONSISTENT*.

If you're editing code, take a few minutes to look at the code around you and
determine its style. If they use spaces around all their arithmetic operators,
you should too. If their comments have little boxes of hash marks around them,
make your comments have little boxes of hash marks around them too.

The point of having style guidelines is to have a common vocabulary of coding so
people can concentrate on what you're saying rather than on how you're saying
it. We present global style rules here so people know the vocabulary, but local
style is also important. If code you add to a file looks drastically different
from the existing code around it, it throws readers out of their rhythm when
they go to read it. Avoid this.
